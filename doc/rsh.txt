# Remote Shell

You can control a remote system from Collapse OS using the
Remote Shell application at B150. All you need are words that
follow the EMIT and KEY? signatures. Serial lines drivers
provide those words.

To use the remote shell, first plug your words into RSH aliases:

' FOO> ' rsh> *! ' FOO<? ' rsh<? *!

FOO> being the "EMIT" word and "FOO<?" being the KEY? word.

Then, it's only a matter of running "rsh". This will repeatedly
poll rsh<? and emit whatever is coming from there and at the
same time, poll KEY? and push whatever key you type to rsh>.

You can stop the remote shell by typing any character over 0x7f.
For example, on a TRS-80 4P, the BREAK key yields 0x80 and will
break the loop.

See hw/acia.txt for tips on configuring a serial line.
